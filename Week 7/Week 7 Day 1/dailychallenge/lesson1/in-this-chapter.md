#Templates
###Templates are a way to generate dynamic html code.

This means adding variables, for loops and if statements inside the HTML code.
The template is written in a template language that combines python and HTML.
There are a lot of python modules that can convert template to html code (theyâ€™re called template engines), flask use jinja2.

Templates can be written in any extension.
